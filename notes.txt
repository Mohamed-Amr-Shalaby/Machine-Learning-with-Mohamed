How to find weights and biases in linear regression:

1) Method 1: Statistical route.
2) Method 2: Learning Method

1) Look at the data, and make a prediction 
2) Tell the model how wrong it is. (Loss function) e.g Eucledian Distance, Manhattan distance, Cosine Deviation
3) A way to tell the model how to improve. (Optimization function, Learning) Grading Descent, Adam, AdaFactor
4) Step 1 until we run out of training steps, or cannot optimize further.

5) Evaluation
